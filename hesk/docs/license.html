<p>&copy; Copyright 2022 Klemen Stirn. All rights reserved.</p>

<p>Some components may be copyrighted by third parties. See component source code and/or included license agreements for details. Trademarks are the property of their respective owners.</p>


<h2>6. Trademark Policy</h2>

<p>HESK is a registered trademark of Klemen Stirn. Certain usages of the Trademark are acceptable, and no specific permission from the Author is needed:</p>

<ul>
<li>there is no commercial intent behind the use,</li>
<li>what You are referring to is, in fact, HESK. If someone is confused into thinking that what isn't HESK is, in fact, HESK, You are probably doing something wrong,</li>
<li>there is no suggestion (through words or appearance) that Your project is approved, sponsored, or affiliated with HESK or its related projects unless it actually has been approved by and is accountable to the Author.</li>
</ul>

<p>Permission from the Author is necessary to use the HESK trademark under any circumstances other than those specifically permitted above. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>any commercial use,</li>
<li>use on or in relation to a software product that includes or is built on top of a product supplied by Author, if there is any commercial intent associated with that product,</li>
<li>use in a domain name or URL,</li>
<li>use for merchandising purposes, e.g., on t-shirts and the like,</li>
<li>use of a name that includes the letters HESK in relation to computer hardware or software,</li>
<li>services relating to any of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>If You wish to have permission for any of the uses above or for any other use which is not specifically referred to in this policy, please contact HESK.COM to verify if Your proposed use is permissible. Permission may only be granted subject to certain conditions, and these may include the requirement that You enter into an agreement with the Author to maintain the quality of the product and/or service which You intend to supply at a prescribed level.</p>

<p>While there may be exceptions, it is very unlikely that HESK.COM will approve Trademark use in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>use of a Trademark in a company name,</li>
<li>use of a Trademark in a domain name that has a commercial intent. The commercial intent can range from promotion of a company or product to collecting revenue generated by advertising,</li>
<li>the calling of any software or product by the name HESK (or another related Trademark), unless that software or product is a substantially unmodified HESK product,</li>
<li>use in combination with any other marks or logos. This include use of a Trademark in a manner that creates a "combined mark," or use that integrates other wording with the Trademark in a way that the public may think of the use as a new mark (for example, Club HESK or HESKBooks, or in a way that by use of special fonts or presentation with nearby words or images conveys an impression that the two are tied in some way),</li>
<li>use in combination with any product or service which is presented as being Certified or Official or formally associated with me or my products or services,</li>
<li>use in a way which implies an endorsement where that doesn't exist, or which attempts to unfairly or confusingly capitalise on the goodwill or brand of the project,</li>
<li>use of a Trademark in a manner that disparages HESK and is not clearly a third-party parody,</li>
<li>on or in relation to a software product which constitutes a substantially modified version of a product supplied by HESK.com, that is to say with material changes to the code, or services relating to such a product,</li>
<li>in a title or metatag of a web page whose sole intention or result is to influence search engine rankings or result listings, rather than for discussion, development, or advocacy of the Trademarks.</li>
</ul>


<h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>

<p>THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; WITH ALL FAULTS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, HESK.COM AND HESK.COM'S DISTRIBUTORS, AND LICENSORS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES THAT THE PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGING. YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SELECTING THE PRODUCT FOR YOUR PURPOSES AND AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.</p>


<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, HESK.COM AND ITS DISTRIBUTORS, DIRECTORS, LICENSORS, CONTRIBUTORS AND AGENTS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THE EULA OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, AND COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH SUCH CLAIM IS BASED. THE HESK.COM COLLECTIVE LIABILITY UNDER THE EULA WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY YOU UNDER THE EULA (IF ANY).</p>


<h2>9. Modification</h2>

<p>The EULA may be modified by HESK.com at any time. The new version of the EULA becomes valid when published on HESK.COM website. You are encouraged to check back for updates regularly.</p>


<h2>10. Other</h2>

<p>The EULA is governed by the laws of Slovenia, European Union. Both You and HESK.COM submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Slovenia. Both You and HESK.COM agree to commence any litigation that may arise hereunder in the courts located in Slovenia.</p>

<p>If any provision hereof shall be held illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable, and the legality, validity and enforceability of all other provisions of the EULA shall not be affected thereby. No delay or failure by either party to exercise or enforce at any time any right or provision hereof shall be considered a waiver thereof or of such party's right thereafter to exercise or enforce each and every right and provision of this Agreement.</p>
